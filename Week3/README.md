### Week 3
#### Topics
Mouse interaction  
Linear Movement  
Interpolation, PCT
<br/>

#### Homework - Generative Graphics
Create a generative image (static/animated) using the concept of PCT together with some math formulas.  
The result has to be visually polished.

_**  
PCT doesn't necessarily have to work with distance/movement. It can work with any kind of task which has a process from a beginning to an end.  
Eg. change the color of a circle from black gradually to white by setting the pct of its brightness._

_Bonus (optional):_   
Study [_ofxGui_](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxGui/) by yourself ;)  
Add a GUI system so you can easily change some of the parameters (eg. size, level of randomness, color) at runtime using an interface.
